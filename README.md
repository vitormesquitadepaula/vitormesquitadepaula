# Hi, I'm Vitor Mesquita 👋

I work in **Data & Innovation R&D for logistics**, building **end-to-end analytics + AI** that turn messy operational data into measurable outcomes.

## What I build
- **Data ingestion pipelines** (idempotent, resilient, concurrent)
- **Decision-support tools** (business rules + ML where it helps)
- **Operational analytics** (SQL-first, Python-heavy, practical outputs)
